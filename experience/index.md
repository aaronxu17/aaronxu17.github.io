## Work Experience
### Intelligent Fusion Technology, Inc.

<p style="text-align:left;">
Wireless System Engineer/Research Scientist<span style="float:right;">
May 2016 to present</span>
</p>
* Design performance evaluation toolkit for satellite communication (SATCOM) system. Study impacts of partial-band noise jamming on frequency hopping SATCOM (FH-SATCOM) based on link-level simulation.* Link calibration based on data-aided channel SNR estimation. Work on back-end SNR sensing (MATLAB) and interaction with GNU radio (USRP testbed) via remote database connection (MySQL).* Write project proposals and create intellectual property leading to patent applications. Submitted one US patent application.
### Utah State University

<p style="text-align:left;">
Research Assistant and Teaching Assistant<span style="float:right;">
Sep. 2011 to May. 2016</span>
</p>
* Mobile association and resource allocation algorithm design for next generation (5G) wireless heterogeneous networks; convex/non-convex and combinatorial problem optimization in wireless communications.* Developed advanced cooperative transmission methods, e.g., CoMP, and improve 30% of cell-edge users' SINR by 10 dB.* Explored new radio access technique, e.g., Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), in wireless heterogeneous networks. The proposed cooperative NOMA scheme can increase network throughput by 20% compared with MU-MIMO scheme.* Analyze video quality-based spectrum and energy efficient video communications over heterogeneous networks. Intelligently allocate bandwidth resource to improve user's perceived video quality in system design.* Conducted lectures for undergraduate and graduate students. Responsible for instructing tutorials, holding office hours, and supervising lab sessions (C and OPNET).

### EMC Corporation

<p style="text-align:left;">
Data Center Operation Intern<span style="float:right;">
Jun. 2015 to Aug. 2015</span>
</p>
* Developing API-driven micro-services that combine into large and complex platforms.* Planning and executing highly parallel distributed object storage transformations and migrations. Specifically, demonstrated load-banlancing scheme design to combat I/O bottleneck in cloud storage systems.* Participating in troubleshooting, capacity planning and analysis, performance analysis activities.
### New York University
