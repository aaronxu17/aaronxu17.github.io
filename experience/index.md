## Work Experience

### Oblon, McClelland, Maier & Neustadt, L.L.P.

<p style="text-align:left;">
Technical Advisor<span style="float:right;">
Oct 2018 to Present</span>
</p>

* Draft patent applications and patent prosecution for domestic and international clients



### Intelligent Fusion Technology, Inc.

<p style="text-align:left;">
Sr. Research Scientist/Wireless System Engineer<span style="float:right;">
May 2016 to Sep 2018</span>
</p>

* SATCOM system emulator and performance evaluation toolkit development.
* Link calibration based on data-aided/non-data-aided SNR estimation. Implemented SNR estimation (MATLAB and C++) and integrated it with GNUradio (USRP testbed) via data exchange by remote database connection (MySQL).
* mmWave propagation modeling in urban environments. Improved the ray tracing performance by using machine learning techniques and saved 40% runtime with 78% prediction accuracy. 
* Cognitive radio system development with a decision tree based jamming detector and classifier. Achieved high throughput, covertness, and jam-resistance
* Write project proposals and create intellectual property leading to patent applications.

### Utah State University

<p style="text-align:left;">
Research Assistant and Teaching Assistant<span style="float:right;">
Sep. 2011 to May. 2016</span>
</p>

* Radio resource management in heterogeneous networks (HetNets), applying convex/non-convex and combinatorial optimization techniques for joint mobile association and resource allocation problems.
* Developed advanced cooperative transmission methods, e.g., CoMP, and improve 30% of cell-edge users' SINR by 10 dB.
* Explored new radio access technique, e.g., Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The proposed cooperative NOMA scheme can increase network throughput by 20% compared with MU-MIMO scheme.
* Tradeoff study between video quality-based spectrum efficiency (QSE) and energy efficiency (QEE). Conducted multi-objective optimization to investigate their impacts on resource allocation and user performance.
* Conducted lectures for undergraduate and graduate students. Responsible for instructing tutorials, holding office hours, and supervising lab sessions (C and OPNET).

### Dell EMC

<p style="text-align:left;">
Data Center Operation Intern<span style="float:right;">
Jun. 2015 to Aug. 2015</span>
</p>

* Developing API-driven micro-services that combine into large and complex platforms.
* Planning and executing highly parallel distributed object storage transformations and migrations. Specifically, demonstrating load-balancing scheme design to combat I/O bottleneck in cloud storage systems.
* Participating in troubleshooting, capacity planning and analysis, performance analysis activities.

### New York University

<p style="text-align:left;">
Graduate Research Assistant<span style="float:right;">
Sep. 2009 to May. 2011</span>
</p>

* Conducted research work in joint precoding/decoding design in Multi-input Multi-output (MIMO) system. Published a conference paper.
