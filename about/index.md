Hello! Welcome to my homepage! My name is **Yiran Xu**`['i:ran, shoo]` (许怡然). I am currently a Sr. Research Scientist at Intelligent Fusion Technology, Inc. 

Email: <aaronxu17@gmail.com>

## Research Interests
* **Satellite communication (SATCOM)**: Frequency hopping (FH) and partial-band noise jamming effects (PBNJ).
* **Wireless heterogeneous network (HetNet)**: Small-cell depolyment, intergerence mitigation, joint mobile association and resource allocation optimization.
* **Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications**: Propagation measurements and channel models.
* **Cognitive radio (CR) system**: Spectrum sensing, SNR estimation, non-cooperative frequency hopping, jamming/interference detection and classification, noise modulated covert communication.
* **Advanced wireless technologies**: Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) processing, MU-MIMO, massive MIMO, non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA).
* **Quality of Experience (QoE) based spectral efficieny (QSE) and energy efficiency (QEE) tradeoff**.

## Research Interests

* **Programming Languages**: C/C++, Java, Python, MATLAB
* **Software**: LaTeX, OPNET
* **Database**: MySQL, SQLite
* **Operating Systems**: Windows, Linux, Mac OS


## Miscellaneous:
* I learnt to ski and snowboard when I was in Logan, Utah. Greatest Snow on Earth!
* I enjoy hiking, road trip, going to the gym after work.
